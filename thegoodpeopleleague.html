    <h1>Welcome to The Good People League</h1>

    <p>This will be our home (temporarily) for all news related to our League. As commissioner, I will try as hard as I can to update and enhance this site, if anyone ever sees it to begin with. On here I will be posting polls and power rankings results, when I learn how to do those things, but in the mean time, I'll be posting updates on the week's matchups and things like why Shane will never win a championship.</p>
